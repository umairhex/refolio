# Browser & URL Details

Rules for favicons, theme colors, URL handling, meta tags, and PWA behavior.

## Rules

### Dynamic theme-color
Set and dynamically update `<meta name="theme-color">` to match the current page background. This merges the browser chrome with your app, creating an immersive, native-like experience.

### Themed favicon for light/dark mode
Provide separate favicon SVGs for light and dark mode using the `media` attribute in your icon metadata. A favicon that clashes with the OS theme looks out of place.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon-light.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)">
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon-dark.svg" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
```

### Monochrome PWA icon for Android
Include a monochrome icon with `"purpose": "monochrome"` in your web manifest for Material You theming on Android. Your PWA icon blends seamlessly into the user's personalized home screen.

### Immersive pinned tab icon
Design pinned-tab favicons whose borders or colors match the tab chrome for a seamless look. A well-integrated pinned tab icon elevates perceived quality.

### Serialize state in URL
Serialize UI state (filters, search queries, sort order, view mode) into URL parameters. Enables sharing, bookmarking, back-button navigation, and session continuity — all for free.

### Drop the www prefix
Stop using the `www.` subdomain — serve your site from the apex domain. The www prefix is a legacy convention; dropping it creates cleaner URLs.

### Use PNG/JPEG for OG images
Use PNG or JPEG for Open Graph images, not WebP. Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, and other platforms have inconsistent WebP support for OG image previews.

### Dynamic favicon for status
Update the favicon in real-time to reflect page status (CI pass/fail, notification count, PR state). The favicon becomes a persistent, zero-cost status indicator visible across all tabs.

### Portal-proof components
Ensure your components work correctly when embedded in iframes, portals, or third-party contexts. Embedded contexts have different sizing, event handling, and style inheritance rules.

### Clickable email with copy fallback
Make email addresses clickable with `mailto:` links, and offer a copy-to-clipboard alternative via an icon. Give users the choice between their mail client and manual paste.

### Rich previews for internal URLs
Detect internal links and render them as rich preview cards with title, description, and thumbnail. A glanceable card is faster to scan than a raw URL.

### Rich previews for external URLs
Fetch Open Graph metadata for external links and display them as rich preview cards. Elevates the reading experience and gives users confidence about where a link leads.

### Prevent swipe-back on horizontal scroll
Apply `overscroll-behavior-x: none` to horizontally scrollable containers to prevent the browser's swipe-back navigation from triggering accidentally.
